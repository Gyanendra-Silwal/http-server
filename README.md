# HTTP-SERVER USING C++

This project focuses on the development of a basic HTTP server using C++. The server is designed to handle HTTP requests and responses, supporting essential methods such as GET and POST, which are fundamental to web communication. By implementing these operations, we aim to create a robust foundation for understanding how web servers function and interact with clients. The implementation utilizes multithreading to efficiently manage multiple client connections, allowing the server to handle concurrent requests without significant delays, thereby enhancing performance and responsiveness. In addition to deepening our understanding of the HTTP protocol, this project provides practical experience in network programming and server design, exploring key aspects of socket programming, connection management, and error handling. The server is capable of serving static files, such as HTML and images, and is designed to be extensible for dynamic content in future iterations, laying the groundwork for more complex web applications. Through this endeavor, we have gained valuable insights into the challenges of building a functional web server and the importance of efficient resource management in networked environments.
